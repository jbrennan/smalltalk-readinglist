Smalltalk Reading List
======================

This repo has an annotated information graphic about selected history of the development of Smalltalk and its influences. It's certainly not exhaustive, but should provide a good starting point. References in the PDF are hyperlinked to proper sources.

Please feel free to share and edit the reading list â€” a Sketch file is provided as the source. This repo is considered public domain.
